# anche assignment for altura nft

to do:
- ✅ error state for nft lists page
- ✅ nft modal
- ✅ loader on search page when the user clicks on enter


known issues:
- haven't found out how to submit emoji .eth addresses to alchemy-sdk, currently alchemy-sdk throws an error
- modal backdrop filter breaks on window resize

possible future tasks:
- tests (unit + e2e)
- make sure document is not scrollable when the modal is open
- structure nft API response, it becomes too messy
- search bar on nfts page, including loading state to refresh data
